Yes, the workspace contains a code snippet that fetches protein sequences from the NCBI website using the Biopython package. Let's break down the relevant parts from the app.py:

Import Necessary Libraries:

The code imports libraries such as Entrez and SeqIO from BioPython, used to interact with NCBI's services to fetch biological data.
Setting Up Entrez:

You must specify an email address for NCBI service through Entrez.email to comply with their usage policies.
Fetch Protein Sequence:

The code links a nucleotide sequence to its corresponding protein using Entrez.elink and fetches the protein sequence using Entrez.efetch. The protein sequence is then read into a record format using SeqIO.
Here's the relevant part of the code to fetch the protein sequence:

from Bio import Entrez, SeqIO
def fetch_protein_sequence(sequence_id):
    Entrez.email = "your_email@example.com"  # Set your email address here
    try:
        # Find protein ID linked to the nucleotide sequence
        protein_link_handle = Entrez.elink(dbfrom="nuccore", db="protein", id=sequence_id)
        protein_link_record = Entrez.read(protein_link_handle)
        if protein_link_record[0]["LinkSetDb"]:
            protein_id = protein_link_record[0]["LinkSetDb"][0]["Link"][0]["Id"]
            print(f"Found protein ID: {protein_id}")
            
            # Fetch protein sequence using the protein ID
            protein_handle = Entrez.efetch(db="protein", id=protein_id, rettype="fasta", retmode="text")
            protein_record = SeqIO.read(protein_handle, "fasta")
            protein_sequence = str(protein_record.seq)
        else:
            print("No linked protein found")
            protein_sequence = "No linked protein sequence found"
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching protein sequence: {str(e)}")
        protein_sequence = "Unable to fetch protein sequence"
    return protein_sequence
Make sure to replace "your_email@example.com" with your actual email address before using the code.
